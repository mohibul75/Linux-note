Here, In this article I am going to point out how a packet is arrived to the application as known as the jouney of a packet.My main goal is to show how the application get the data.  Everything of this article is my learning from the other's article from internet and tutorial's videos. And Everything is described here in very simplified way.  

The application needs the data of a packet. There are some header in the packet before the data. These headers are required for the checksum to verify the packet is correct and not corrupted. Total three checksum is used here frame checksum, Ip checksum and the tcp checksum. 

The first header of packet is Ethernet header which is also called L2 header. Three main properties of L2 header are Source and destination MAC address and type. Here the type propertise is IP. The second Header is IP header and here is also some propertise. The main propertise among them are length, IP type, header checksum, destination and source IP . For our case the IP type value is TCP. The next header of a packet is TCP header which also consist destination and source port and the checksum. Then the actual data is in a packet.

The packet starts its journey by arriving at the NIC (Network Interface Controller) through either the airwaves or an Ethernet connection. The NIC is the first to receive the packet and then checks it against a MAC address filter. You can bypass this filter by enabling promiscuous mode. When this mode is on, there's no need to compare MAC addresses.

After that, the packet's Frame Checksum (FCS) is verified to ensure it hasn't been corrupted. Once confirmed, the packet is stored in the system memory using Direct Memory Access (DMA). This process is managed by a pre-programmed driver. The packets find their place in a buffer, and the driver allocates free memory for them, instructing the NIC about the buffer locations. This entire process is known as the ingress road.
